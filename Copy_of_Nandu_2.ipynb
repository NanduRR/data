It aired on April 13, 2014.\\n\\nThe episode focuses principally on the long-awaited royal wedding between Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell, which ends tragically as Joffrey dies after drinking poisoned wine at the reception, a plot development that despite being in the books came as a shock to viewers since it abruptly killed the show\\'s principal villain just a few episodes after the Red Wedding had violently killed off several of the show\\'s protagonists.

The idea of the map was therefore moved into the title sequence.  For the original pilot, the showrunners Benioff and Weiss initially wrote the title sequence as a crow\\'s flight from King\\'s Landing to Winterfell;  however, the production team at Elastic thought the idea was too flat and devised the idea of using 3-D models within a sphere that represents the world of the show. The sphere was used to obviate the question of what might lie beyond the horizon of the map, and the whole sphere is lit by the sun in the middle.

It is based on ''A Song of Ice and Fire'',  a series of novels written by George R. R. Martin. The first set was Westeros Edition and was released in August 2002. It has since won two Origins Awards. The game's primary designer is Eric Lang, the lead developer is Nate French, with Damon Stone serving as associate designer.\\n\\nIn the game, players assume the leadership of one of the great houses of Westeros vying for control of King's Landing and the Iron Throne. To accomplish this, players launch military attacks against their opponents, undermine their opponents’ plans with intrigues of their own, and make power plays to win the support of the realm.\\n\\n==Factions==\\nEach house represents one of the main factions involved in the struggle for the Iron Throne emulated by the AGoT LCG. Each house provides different strengths and weaknesses, allowing for various play styles to interact within the same game. Certain cards are restricted to one or two houses, giving each house a unique flavor. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '817616288a6b3b410cbf5c61a4ed641f'}>,\n",

''Standing'' cards are upright, and are ready for use to pay for effects, or to initiate or defend challenges. ''Kneeling'' cards are rotated 90 degrees to the side, to indicate that they've been used to pay for an effect, or to initiate or defend a challenge. Some game effects are able to ''kneel'' cards (changing them from ''standing'' to ''kneeling'') or ''stand'' cards (changing them from ''kneeling'' to ''standing'') in order to manipulate the resources a player has available.\\n\\n''Unique'' cards represent the special individuals, places, items, and happenings in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 23}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '7844a989bdeaf7bdd4790315502deede'}>,\n",

Unique characters, locations, and attachments may be placed with copies that are already in play to serve as ''duplicates''. Duplicates may be discarded to save the unique card from being killed or discard.\\n\\n''Triggered Effects'' are a type of game effect that a player chooses to use in order to change the game state in some way. Triggered effects are indicated by a bold name of a phase (one of ''Plot'', ''Draw'', ''Marshalling'', ''Challenges'', ''Dominance'', or ''Standing'') or ''Any phase'' to indicate when the effect may be used.

R. Martin, and its television adaptation ''Game of Thrones''.\\n\\nIntroduced in 1996's ''A Game of Thrones'', Littlefinger is the master of coin on King Robert's small council. He is a childhood friend of Catelyn Stark, having grown up with her and her two siblings at Riverrun. He subsequently appeared in Martin's books ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), and ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005). He is set to appear in the forthcoming novel ''The Winds of Winter''. Littlefinger's primary character attributes are his cunning and boundless ambition. Originally hailing from a minor family with little wealth or influence, Baelish used manipulation, bribery, and the connections he secured at Riverrun to gain power and prestige in King's Landing. Since then, his various intrigues have directly caused several major events that have impacted Westeros, including the framing of Tyrion Lannister for the attempt on Bran Stark's life, the downfall of Lord Eddard Stark, the deaths of Lord Jon Arryn and King Joffrey Baratheon, and the War of the Five Kings.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '186f29e83a7d51855aa4cfded4f33355'}>,\n",

His father befriended Lord Hoster Tully during the War of the Ninepenny Kings, and Tully took the young Petyr as a ward. Petyr grew up at House Tully\\'s castle Riverrun with Hoster\\'s daughters Catelyn and Lysa, and son Edmure; Edmure nicknamed Petyr \"Littlefinger\" in reference to his short stature and his family\\'s lands on the smallest of the Fingers.

Petyr was a sly, mischievous child with the ability to always look contrite after his mischief. He became infatuated with Catelyn and claims to have lost his virginity to her while drunk; in reality, he lost it to Lysa, who was obsessed with him. When Catelyn was betrothed to Brandon Stark (Eddard Stark\\'s elder brother), Petyr brazenly challenged him to a duel for her hand in marriage but lost easily to Brandon. Petyr\\'s life was spared at Catelyn\\'s behest. During his convalescence Petyr impregnated Lysa, but the pregnancy ended in a forced abortion, and Petyr was banished from Riverrun.\\n\\nEven after her marriage to Jon Arryn, Lysa remained in love with Petyr. Her patronage saw Baelish appointed as customs officer at Gulltown, a position he excelled at.

According to Myles McNutt from Cultural Learnings, the episode \"never evolves into a particularly exciting hour of television, content mostly to sketch out the boundaries of the season’s storylines in preparation for the oncoming climax.\"The final scene, where Brienne is forced to fight a bear, was very well received: IGN\\'s Matt Fowler called it \"a spectacular moment\", HitFix\\'s Alan Sepinwall deemed it \"gorgeously staged and executed\", and David Sims found it \"tense, thrilling television\".

When Ned confronts Cersei about the truth, she has him imprisoned for treason after he publicly denounces Joffrey. Ned is convinced by Varys that if he goes to his death honorably, as he is prepared to do, his daughters will not suffer for it.

He enjoys seeing people executed by defenestration, whether they are guilty or not (of note, Robin seems to enjoy seeing \\'\\'anything\\'\\' fall through the moon door, since the first thing he does when Petyr Baelish brings him a toy is to gleefully throw it through the moon door). In Season 1, he is present at Tyrion Lannister\\'s trial, but shows little to no interest in the details and continuously begs his mother to make the \"little Lannister baby-man\" fly, which would mean Tyrion being executed, although Tyrion is acquitted. In Season 4, he greets Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish as \"Uncle Petyr\" and meets his cousin, Sansa Stark, for the first time.

Martin, and its television adaptation ''Game of Thrones''. He is the second son of Steffon Baratheon, the lord of Storm's End, and his wife Lady Cassana Estermont, and brother to King Robert and Renly. He is the Lord of Dragonstone and a claimant to the Iron Throne after his elder brother's death. Stannis's goals are frequently impeded by his lack of manpower and resources, owing to his unpopularity with other noble houses. He must therefore rely on the counsel of the foreign priestess Melisandre and his right-hand man, lowborn smuggler Davos Seaworth, who later becomes his Hand of the King. Stannis often struggles to escape the shadow of his two more overtly charismatic brothers, particularly Robert.\\n\\nThough first mentioned in 1996's ''A Game of Thrones'', Stannis formally appeared in ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000) and ''A Dance with Dragons'' (2011).

Stannis is a divisive character among fans of the books and television show alike, enjoying both great popularity for his dedication to justice and dark horse status, as well as opposition for his unrelenting attitude towards the Iron Throne. He has earned particular attention for the differences in his characterization between the novels and show, particularly during season five.\\n\\n== Character description ==\\nStannis Baratheon is the younger brother of King Robert and older brother of Renly.

When Stannis was fourteen he witnessed his parents' death in a shipwreck off the coast of House Baratheon's castle of Storm's End, and subsequently lost his faith in the Seven Gods.\\n\\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, a teenage Stannis holds Storm's End in Robert's absence, but is besieged by Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne for the best part of the year. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 2}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '742aad591829819999c419a8245199ad'}>,\n",

When Eddard Stark arrives to lift the siege, Stannis knights Davos as reward for his aid, but also insists that Davos have four fingers removed as punishment for his years of illegal smuggling; Davos agrees, on the condition that Stannis removes the fingers himself.  Stannis is subsequently tasked with building a new royal fleet to assault Dragonstone and capture the island, but arrives to find that Aerys II Targaryen's children Viserys and the newborn Daenerys had fled.

It is suggested that this was because Robert was following the custom of granting Dragonstone to the king's heir, but Stannis perceives it as an insult.\\n\\nSeveral years later, Stannis is married to Lady Selyse Florent, but Robert soiled their wedding bed by deflowering Selyse's cousin Delena, further insulting Stannis. Stannis and Selyse have a single daughter together, Shireen, who nearly dies in infancy after contracting greyscale and is left disfigured.
