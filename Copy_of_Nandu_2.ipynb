After his betrothed Lyanna Stark was kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen, Robert, along with the aid of her brother and his close friend, Eddard Stark, and their foster guardian Jon Arryn, initiated a bloody rebellion against the \"Mad King\" Aerys II Targaryen.  After crushing the Targaryen dynasty and winning the war, Robert took the Iron Throne and established the Baratheon dynasty as its first king.  However, due to Lyanna\\'s untimely death during the war, Robert instead married Tywin Lannister\\'s daughter Cersei to ensure political stability.

Sketches would be in black and white with the aim of identifying the correct style, tone of voice, scale and detail, for approval by HBO and Tourism Ireland. Once approved, the line drawings would pass through the colourisation phase. The colourisation phase is a lengthy process of converting the monochrome designs into a coloured piece of illustrated artwork. This process considers line widths, contrasts and resolution and also identifies the correct colour palette to use per section.\\n\\n=== Weaving ===\\nThe illustrated artwork is then passed to a hand-weaving specialist.

The Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, near Holywood, County Down, was used as the secret location for this work.

Soon afterwards, it is announced that Walda has given birth to a boy; Ramsay immediately kills Roose by stabbing him in the stomach, before setting his dogs upon Walda and the baby, severely jeopardizing House Bolton and leaving Ramsay as the last remaining Bolton. Ramsay is ultimately killed when Jon Snow retakes Winterfell in the Battle of the Bastards, leaving House Bolton extinct.\\n\\n== References ==\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 14}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e93b46ebe3293699bd24ab071f3bef3c'}>,\n",

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has stated that \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.\"A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Just like people\\'s capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story. Benioff said, \"George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy.

In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. The series also reflects the substantial death rates in war.\\n\\n===Inspirations and derivations===\\nAlthough the first season closely follows the events of the first novel, later seasons have made significant changes.

The scheming Cersei Lannister evokes Isabella, the \"she-wolf of France\" (1295–1358).

As a part of this update, Peterson created audio for the course\\'s lessons and exercises.\\n\\n==Derivative languages==\\nIn the world of the novel and TV series, the Nine Free Cities of Essos speak variants of High Valyrian, described by the character Tyrion in \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' as \"not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues\". The cities of Slaver\\'s Bay speak related languages, descended from High Valyrian with the substrate of the local Ghiscari languages. Peterson noted that with regard to the vocabulary of the derived languages, \"If it’s got a j in an odd place, it’s probably Ghiscari in origin.\"Peterson described the relationship between High Valyrian and the Free Cities languages as being similar to that between classical Latin and the Romance languages, or more accurately between Classical Arabic and the modern varieties of Arabic, in that High Valyrian is intelligible, with some difficulty, to a speaker of a local Essoan language.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 17}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '5178fa8ccd6dcf01195eff10561ca1c4'}>,\n",

It appeared in the third-season premiere episode \"Valar Dohaeris\".  Peterson created the Astapori dialogue by first writing the text in High Valyrian, then applying a series of regular grammar and sound changes to simulate the changes in natural languages over a long period of time.\\n\\nFor example, Astapori Valyrian has lost all long vowels (designated with a macron) and most diphthongs. Between vowels, b, d, g have become v, ð, ɣ; subsequently, p, t, k have become b, d, g in the same environment.\\nAs a result, an \"Unsullied\" is rendered as \\'\\'Dovaogēdy\\'\\'  in High Valyrian, but as \\'\\'Dovoghedhy\\'\\'  in Astapori.

Similarly, Astapori Valyrian has lost the case system of High Valyrian, so the word order is more reliably subject–verb–object (SVO) and the four genders of High Valyrian have been reduced to two, with three definite articles: \\'\\'ji\\'\\'  (animate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ziry\\'\\'  \"him/her (accusative)\"), \\'\\'vi\\'\\'  (inanimate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ūī\\'\\'  \"it (accusative)\"), and \\'\\'po\\'\\'  (plural, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'pōnte\\'\\'  \"them (accusative)\"). There is also an indefinite article, \\'\\'me\\'\\' , derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'mēre\\'\\'  (\"one\"). Word stress is less predictable than in High Valyrian, but commands are stressed word-finally (for example: \\'\\'ivetrá\\'\\').\\n\\n=== Meereenese Valyrian ===\\n\\nMeereenese Valyrian appears in Seasons 4 and 6 of \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'. Like Astapori Valyrian, it lacked long vowels as well as the sound /y/. However, its phonology departs considerably more from High Valyrian; for example, \"Unsullied\" is \\'\\'Thowoá\\'\\' θo.woˈa, whereas in High Valyrian it is \\'\\'Dovaogēdy\\'\\' do.vao.ˈɡeː.dy and in Astapori Valyrian it is \\'\\'Dovoghedhy\\'\\' do.vo.ˈɣe.ði.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 19}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'deef84e95d813635e03fd89737d017f6'}>,\n",

Martin, and its television adaptation ''Game of Thrones''. He is the second son of Steffon Baratheon, the lord of Storm's End, and his wife Lady Cassana Estermont, and brother to King Robert and Renly. He is the Lord of Dragonstone and a claimant to the Iron Throne after his elder brother's death. Stannis's goals are frequently impeded by his lack of manpower and resources, owing to his unpopularity with other noble houses. He must therefore rely on the counsel of the foreign priestess Melisandre and his right-hand man, lowborn smuggler Davos Seaworth, who later becomes his Hand of the King. Stannis often struggles to escape the shadow of his two more overtly charismatic brothers, particularly Robert.\\n\\nThough first mentioned in 1996's ''A Game of Thrones'', Stannis formally appeared in ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000) and ''A Dance with Dragons'' (2011).

Those kingdoms are spread across nine regions: the North, the Iron Islands, the Riverlands, the Vale, the Westerlands, the Stormlands, the Reach, the Crownlands, and Dorne. A massive wall of ice and old magic separates the Seven Kingdoms from the largely unmapped area to the north. The vast continent of Essos is located east of Westeros, across the Narrow Sea. The closest foreign nations to Westeros are the Free Cities, which is a collection of independent city-states along the western edge of Essos. The lands along the southern coastline of Essos are called the Lands of the Summer Sea and include Slaver's Bay and the ruins of Valyria.

The conversation between Jon Snow and Sansa Stark shows Sansa\\'s lingering resentment that she has been insufficiently credited for securing the alliance with the Vale, and also highlights Jon and Sansa\\'s respective, differing identification of the White Walkers and Cersei as primary threats. The dialogue between Jaime and Cersei emphasizes that, with her children dead, Cersei is morally unconstrained and lacks Daenerys\\'s concern for innocents. The writers deliberately excluded dialogue from the scene of Daenerys\\'s arrival at Dragonstone, to preserve the gravitas of that moment.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 3}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '74f79a6906f45a08549dcba339e0bc42'}>,\n",
