The \"Light of the Seven\" is the first time piano is used in the music for \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'. It was nominated by the International Film Music Critics Association for Film Music Composition of the Year.\\n\\n==Background==\\nIn an interview, Djawadi spoke about \"Light of the Seven\", which largely consisted of piano, something unusual for the series. Djawadi stated, \"The interesting thing to me was the use of the piano. When we started the season showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached out to me and said, \\'There\\'s something coming up in episode 10.\\'We talked about the \\'Light of the Seven\\', and how it needed to be a new piece of music.

The piano is not really in the language of the \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' score.\"Djawadi had tried other instruments, including playing the whole tune with harp, but none of them sounded right, eventually he settled on the colder sound of the piano.\\n\\nDjawadi said: \"It all felt like a perfect fit. What\\'s great about the scene, too, is there\\'s hardly any dialogue. It\\'s nine minutes long. I knew I had to start minimal and give it space. Let notes ring, then give it space, and build up the anticipation from there, without tipping in either direction.\"Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, \"The Rains of Castamere\", in order to create more of a mystery. The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, and Djawadi instructed the boys to sing in such a way that although it is \"not out of tune, but you get that feeling of Something’s wrong.\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '977c3b65c1be94ddf8fa65b0bce87690'}>,\n",

The strings I recorded all together. Even the solo instruments, I recorded them separately — the solo violins and solo cellists were recorded separately. The piano, I played. And the organ as well.\"In another interview, Djawadi talked about the process, saying, \"That was the big guidance for me, in how I wanted to build this piece, It\\'s a different instrument, and I put it in an upper register, but the idea is that it\\'s building something that stays the same but changes over time. Of course, now that I say that, people might be like, \\'No, it\\'s not really that.\\'And it\\'s not staying true to the form.

But there are definitely moments where it defaults to that.\"==Composition==\\n\"Light of the Seven\" has a duration of approximately ten minutes. When Djawadi originally composed the piece, he intended at first to make it a passacaglia. The instrumentation of \"Light of the Seven\" consists of piano, organ, strings and two boy soloists. On why he decided to use two young soloists instead of a full choir, Djawadi said, \"I felt that two of them were more haunting than using a full choir, because it\\'s a smaller environment, when they\\'re running around in the catacombs.\"==Credits and personnel==\\nPersonnel adapted from the album liner notes.\\n\\n* Ramin Djawadi – composer, primary artist, producer\\n\\n* David Benioff – liner notes\\n* D.B.

Described as an ugly (\"for all the world like a gargoyle\"), malformed dwarf with different colored eyes, green and black, Tyrion possesses the golden blond hair of a Lannister but has a complicated relationship with the rest of them.

Rather than divide the text in half chronologically, Martin opted to instead split the material by character and location, resulting in \"two novels taking place simultaneously\" with different casts of characters. Published in 2005, \\'\\'A Feast for Crows\\'\\' is narrated primarily by characters in the South of the Seven Kingdoms and in the new locations of the Iron Islands and Dorne. \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' features characters in the North and across the narrow sea, although Jaime Lannister, Cersei Lannister, Arya Stark, Areo Hotah and Victarion and Asha Greyjoy appear in both volumes.\\n\\nApproximately one-third of the published \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' consists of material that had been written for the pre-split \\'\\'A Feast for Crows\\'\\', although much of this has been rewritten by Martin.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 16}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '7bbd3364b026fa497256948cc4edb618'}>,\n",

He explained that he always tries to put himself in the skin of his characters when writing from their perspective, and develops bonds with them. He even felt attached to the minor characters killed during the massacre. It was so painful for him that he skipped the chapter and continued writing, and only when the rest of the book was finished, he \"forced himself\" to come back to the dreaded scene. In 2012, at ComicCon he even joked that \"he will visit a country with no television when the episode goes on air\".\\n\\nMartin also said he killed off Robb because he believed the audience would assume that the story was about Ned Stark\\'s heir avenging his death and wished to keep them guessing.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has stated that \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.\"A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Just like people\\'s capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story. Benioff said, \"George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy. He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe.\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 4}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '8011c8d05e1a913e59055eb5a523f31e'}>,\n",

In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. The series also reflects the substantial death rates in war.\\n\\n===Inspirations and derivations===\\nAlthough the first season closely follows the events of the first novel, later seasons have made significant changes. According to David Benioff, the series is \"about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way\".\\n\\nThe novels and their adaptations base aspects of their settings, characters, and plot on events in European history.

The scheming Cersei Lannister evokes Isabella, the \"she-wolf of France\" (1295–1358).
